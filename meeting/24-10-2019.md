# 24-10-2019 Meeting note
    According to last meeting, we start the first step - Classical Hole Detection 
## Attendees
    - DB625378    Mok Kuai Un
    - DB625369    Ng Kim Hou
    - Prof. Yain Whar SI, Lawrence
    - PhD student. Se-Hang Cheong

## Finished items
    Find the hole by algorithm and fill in the color. Nodes and edges are recolored and enlarged.

    
## Discussion
    We discussed about division of work, the position of the project, and review progress.

    - Division of work, there are two methods to achieve Hole Detection, that are step one and two. Classical Hole Detection Algorithm by Image Processing and Hole Detection Algorithm by Topological Methods. Therefore, we achieve one separately.

    - The position of the project, we discussed about what will the position of the project finally is. We can make a research, research the accuracy; the other side, we can make a tools, a software for people use. 

    - Review progress, check the code and the result, the result is conform but the progress is slow.

## Challenges
    Hole Detection Algorithm by Topological Methods is a quite hard for us, because it is a new thing for us, we have not any experience about topology.

## Schedule
    We should finish the Stage 1 in mid-November
    Start step 2 now
