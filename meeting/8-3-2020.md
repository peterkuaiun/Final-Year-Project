# 8-3-2020 Meeting note
    In this meeting, we review the progress of last 3 months. The system of hole detection by CTA, and two
    critirias of CTA. Moreover, tested the pre-trained model and generated the dataset.
    
## Attendees
    - Professor  Yain Whar SI, Lawrence
    - DB625378    Mok Kuai Un
    - DB625369    Ng Kim Hou
    - Mr. Se-Hang Cheong
    
## Finished items
    - Generated the Ground truth dataset and 10 Force-Directed dataset.
    - Tested some pre-trained models.
    - Completed the system of hole detection by CTA, including image size scaling, coordinate shift to positive 
      and enlarge the canvas size. 
    - Designed the experiments for the system of CTA, includeing the criteria of Node Identifer Matching and 
      Hole Count Statistics.
    - Finish the experiments for system of CTA, and processed the result of the experiments.

## Discussion
    - Evaluate the performance of those pre-trained model.
    - write expriment of those pre-trained model at report.
    - consider to use GNUplot for generating the chart of experiment result.
    - Make Summary and contribution in report.

## Challenges
    - Train a model for detect Irregular Shapes.
    - How to generate a chart of experiment result taht is easy to observe.  

## Schedule
    The next meeting will be after two weeks.
