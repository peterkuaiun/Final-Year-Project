# 6-12-2019 Meeting note
    In this meeting, we genarated the sensor network, setted the parameters.

## Attendees
    - DB625378    Mok Kuai Un
    - DB625369    Ng Kim Hou
    - Mr. Se-Hang Cheong

## Finished items
    We started using some models to identify the images, we are Delving into YOLO.

## Discussion
    Before the neural network, training data is also a important part, we have to prepare a effective set for the training. Therefore, we need to genarate massive training data.

## Challenges
    The training data is not only a sensor network include node and edge, it should be a processed image that is marked and highlighted the hole and the node of id in the hole. Genarate massive training data means massive storage space, and time.

## Schedule
    The next meeting will be at 2nd semester. There should be a massive training data at that time.
