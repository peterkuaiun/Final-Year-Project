# 2019-10-4 Meeting note
	In the meeting we discussed about hole detection of sensor network by deep learning methods.
## Attendees
    - DB625378    Mok Kuai Un
    - DB625369    Ng Kim Hou
    - Mr. Se-Hang Cheong

## Finished items
	Used network generator CNCAHNetGenerator to generated the sensor network dataset.
	
## Discussion
	Introduted 4 Steps to realize hole detection of sensor network by deep learning methods.
	It is included: 
		- Classical Hole Detection Algorithm by Image Processing
		- Hole Detection Algorithm by Topological Methods
		- Evaluation of Neural Networks for Hole Detection
		- Hole Detection Algorithm by Deep Neural Network

	Divied 2 Stages to we should to achieve in our final year project.
		- Stage 1: Using Image Processing to achieve hole detection.
		- Stage 2: Using Topological Methods to achieve hole detection.
## Challenges
	In Stage 1, firstly we should achieve those approachs:
	 - Network image or dataset convert to bitmap
	 - Hole Detection and fill in the color
	 - Find the nodes around the hole
	
	In Stage 2, Using the Topological Methods dataset to achieve Hole Detecton.
	Detect the hole from the networks which is all nodes without coordinate.
## Schedule
	We should finish the Stage 1 in mid-November
	After Semester Break start to Stage 2
