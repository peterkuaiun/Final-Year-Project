## Attendees
    - DB625378    Mok Kuai Un
    - DB625369    Ng Kim Hou
    - Prof. Yain Whar SI, Lawrence
    - Mr. Se-Hang Cheong

## Finished items
    We finished two algorithms to find the hold, then high line the area and mark a number. It can output the node and edge of the hold.
    One is using gray scale mothod, another one is using dfs find cycle.

## Discussion
    We reorganize the entire report process, now we are more clearly understand what is the target and final goal. The most important is our contribution, it divides our work clearly.

## Challenges
    Neural network is a big challenges for us now. Ng Kim Hou will search about that, and Mok Kuai Un will be continued to develop some new algorithms for hole detection.

## Schedule
    We will stop the project before final examinations.
